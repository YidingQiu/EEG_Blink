### EEG Blink detector
The projecs experiments with various deep learning models and EEG preprocessing for blink detection.
Currently the following classes of models have been invistigated:
* LSTM with 1 and 3 raw EEG channels
* LSTM + CNN with 1 and 3 EEG channels converted to images representing wavelet coefficients
* TCN with 1 and 3 raw EEG channels
* CNN with 1 and 3 EEG channels converted to images representing wavelet coefficients
